### NVL Python Wrapper

This project contains an experimental Python wrapper with the NVL JavaScript library.

##### Getting started

To build the Python packages, run

```
yarn
yarn build
yarn install-package

To test if the wrapper is working and see some examples, you can use the `neo4j-nvl-example.ipynb` notebook:
