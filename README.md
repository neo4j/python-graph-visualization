# NVL Python Wrapper

This project contains an experimental Python wrapper with the NVL JavaScript library.

## Getting started

To build the Python packages, run

```sh
yarn          # Install JavaScript dependencies
yarn build    # Build JavaScript resources to be used by Python code
pip install . # run with --editable for development mode
```

To test if the wrapper is working and see some examples checkout the `/examples` directory

```sh
jupyter notebook examples/neo4j-nvl-example.ipynb
```
