Graph Visualization for Python by Neo4j documentation
=====================================================

This is the documentation for the ``neo4j-viz`` Python library by Neo4j.
The library allows you to visualize graph data interactively in Python using a simple API.

The library wraps the `Neo4j Visualization JavaScript library (NVL) <https://neo4j.com/docs/nvl/current/>`_, and provides additional features for working with graph data in Python.
Notably, there are convenience methods for importing data from `Pandas DataFrames <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ and `Neo4j Graph Data Science <https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/>`_.
